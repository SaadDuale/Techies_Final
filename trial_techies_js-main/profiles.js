      "She was one of only two women in her class to major in physics. She excelled at school and landed a job as a mathematical/data analyst for NASA. She worked at NASA from 1964 to 1995, conducting large-scale experiments, developing computer data systems, and most notably, spearheading the development of the first satellite to send images from space, “Landsat.” The technology she developed is still used by NASA today.",

      "Used his background in computer science and visual arts to help bridge the early gap between technology and art. He is the inventor of Lingo, a scripting language that renders visuals in computer programs. Many programs that use graphics, animation, sound, and video for interactive simulations still use Lingo to this day. It’s also been used to create the programs that are now used in video games, web design, animation and graphics.",

      "Annie J Easley was a NASA scientist. When she began her career, she was only one of four Black employees out of 2,500 employees. Her most famous work was on the Centaur rocket, a first-of-its-kind rocket that used a unique fuel system. Its legacy still endures today. She had a long career with NASA, working on extremely advanced technology while overcoming Jim Crow laws and discrimination.",

With one computer taking up an entire room, he lead the team that engineered HP’s entrance into the computer market. In 2003, he was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Council’s Hall of Fame.",
